# How to start

 If you want to create a standalone executable (.exe) file from a Python script without displaying a console window, you can achieve this using the `--noconsole` option with PyInstaller. This option prevents the console window from appearing when you run the executable. Here's how you can do it:

1.  Install PyInstaller (if you haven't already) using pip:

`pip install pyinstaller` 

2.  Navigate to the directory containing your Python script using the command prompt or terminal.
    
3.  Use PyInstaller with the `--onefile` and `--noconsole` options:
    
`pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole your_script.py` 

Replace `your_script.py` with the name of your Python script.

4.  After the process is complete, you'll find a 'dist' directory within your script's directory. Inside the 'dist' directory, you'll find the standalone executable file with the same name as your script.

This will create an executable without displaying a console window. Keep in mind that if your script generates any console output (e.g., print statements), you won't be able to see them when using the `--noconsole` option.

Remember that PyInstaller may not be suitable for all types of scripts, especially those with complex dependencies or external resources. You might need to fine-tune the PyInstaller options or perform additional configuration to ensure your executable works as intended.
